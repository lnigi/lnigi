<h1>Hey there, welcome to my profile!</h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
I'm a Computer Engineering student at Universit√† degli Studi di Siena. About the progress for my studies, I'm currently writing my final thesis for my BSc. 
I reckon I will further my studies in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

<h2>What can I find here?</h2>
On this profile you can find the code I wrote for my course projects during my studies. Hopefully, in the future I'll add more advanced stuff as I progress with my studies.

<h2>About me</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although I've always liked technology, I started learning in the field of computer science only in the last three years, when I started university: previously I had been studying at Liceo Classico (to be clear, the main subjects were about literature, with a particular interest in Italian, English, Latin and Greek literature).</li>
  <li>I have a 1st Dan Black Belt in karate.</li>
</ul>
